# Coding-Quiz

Trivia quiz about coding.

## Project Description

Using a combination of VS Code, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Jquery I developed a trivia quiz that will take the user through a series of five questions about coding. The quiz is timed for the user to complete within 75 seconds. If the user answers a question incorrectly they will be deducted 10 seconds from the timer. If time runs out before the quiz is complete the user fails to pass. Once the quiz is complete the program will generate the users high score, ask for their intials and post it to the page. This site and application utilizies Javascript functions to create and allow this quiz to run effectively.
